Elenor Server contains all the classes necessary for the Eleno-r application and the Mission Control application to function. Currently, Elenor Server follows a repository design pattern which is total overkill and will be refactored. For more on this see my blog post! It's a deep dive into using Entity Framework with a Repository Design pattern. I explore if this is necessary, and what the benefits are. TL / DR: Don't blindly follow tutorials.",
