          <p>I am passionate about creating meangingful experiences for others. I've worn a lot of shoes in my life and incorporate these experiences into development to form a multi-disciplinary approach to my work.</p>
          <br />
          <p>I have a passion for continued education and am currently focusing on an ASP.NET + JavaScript stack. I like to document my progress in blog posts, so be sure to check them out. When I'm not coding I generally spend time going out with my partner, hking with friends, relaxing with my cat Oliver, cooking, exercising, or reading. We are more than our jobs and I belive in pursuing what makes you feel good. I'm lucky to have found a passion in coding as it speaks to my logical and creative sides.</p>
