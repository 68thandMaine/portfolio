# Portfolio Integration Tests

The integration tests that I have written for my portfolio provide assurance that:

- Routes correctly redirect.
- Element characteristics exist when interacted with.
- Certain DOM elements are hidden or seen based on the state of the application.

In generall Cypress proves that the components that I have created all work in harmony together to achieve the functionality I want my portfolio to have.
